## Concept and Background of the Project
+ This project is done to learn about reactive programming, user authentification with JSON-web-tokens and to make something useful for me and my girlfriend. The idea behind the project is to program a frontend where we (my girlfriend and I) can log in and write down items to our shopping list and either one of us could mark items as "bought", if we went to the supermarket. This requires a backend which could be found here (TODO) and this frontend page.
+ The project is based on the knowlage I have gained from the following ressources: 
    - https://www.bezkoder.com/angular-12-jwt-auth/
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhggNGsSQyg (for reactive programming)
